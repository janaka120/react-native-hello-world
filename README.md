Getting Started
-------------


Before running the app, you should do some configurations in your machine. (**Prerequisites**)

 1. The first thing you need to do is [install React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/getting-started.html#content).

	The guide linked above provides instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux users, as well as instructions for preparing your Android and iOS environments.

	**if you already install react-native you can skip that step**

 2. Setup the project
	```
    $ git clone https://github.com/janaka120/react-native-hello-world
    $ cd react-native-hello-world
    $ npm install
	```

 3. Running on iOS/ Android 

	> **on IOS :**
  >- Mac OS and Xcode are required. 
	>- Open HelloWorld.xcodeproj in Xcode
	>- See [Running on device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html) if you want to use a physical device.
	
	> **on Android:**
	>- Start an Android emulator ([Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) is recommended).
	>- Run in terminal
	```
	$ react-native run-android
	```
	>-  **Note: ** if js server is not started, run this comment in terminal
